# game-room-system-better
This is a simple web app project that emulates the behaviour of online games with room systems.

# why a new repo
The original repo was a quickly and horribly made, while being essentially a wrongly skimmed down version of an implemented system. I also just wanted to start from fresh and just stop using something stupid.

# completeness
technically completed, not sure if i wanna add more features

# setup
```
git clone <url>
npm i
mkdir Logs DATABASE
node .
```
