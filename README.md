# game-room-system-better
This is a simple web app project that emulates the behaviour of online games with room systems.

# So erm...
There will be a v3, this is because this project is meant to be a proof of concept, the room model is very broken and player iteration can be done MUCH better. I might just end up using plain objects.

# completeness
technically completed, not sure if i wanna add more features

# setup
```
git clone <url>
